I usually have somewhat high standards for myself
(and sometimes for people around me which is not good!).
It does not make me happy to relax too much,
as I felt I was wasting time and I could have achieved more.
Being very productive, however,
is only possible if the motivation-to-procrastination ratio is right.
A balance needs to be reached.
So I gradually figured out this Rule of 5-2-5, a combination of techniques working for my self-improvement.

Priority. The first 5 of 5-2-5 stands for your 5 most important goals.
These could be long-term or medium-term.
To really know what the five most important things to you,
you have to know *yourself* first. What matters the most? Family/Friendship/Health/Spirit/Relaxation/Career/Wealth/...? This one is the toughest sub-rule of the three,
as the goals (i.e. yourself) might change over time therefore require constant exploration.

Routine. The 2 means [Top-2-do](#TBD).

Action. The last 5 tells me to just do it for 5 minutes.

Give it a go!
Just do it for 5 minutes, for each of the Top-2-do everyday, guided by your 5 most important goals.
(Please be reminded of applying this to yourself, not people close to you.)
