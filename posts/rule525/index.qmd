I usually have somewhat high standards for myself
(and sometimes for people around me which is not good!).
relaxing too much -> not happy;
too tired to be very hardworking;
So I gradually figured out this Rule of 5-2-5, a combination of techniques working for my self-improvement.

The first 5 stands for the 5 most important goals.

The 2 means [Top-2-do](#TBD).

The last 5 tells me to just do it for 5 minutes.

Give it a go! Just do it for 5 minutes, for each of the Top-2-do everyday, guided by your 5 most important goals. (Please be reminded of applying this to yourself, not people close to you.)
