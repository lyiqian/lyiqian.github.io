![df command after mounting the new partition](diskfree.png)

I have been using a dual system of Windows and Ubuntu, 
and recently running out of storage space on Ubuntu.
This caused various issues including occasional failure to recover from sleep.

Surely, there were already
[some](https://askubuntu.com/questions/871825/add-more-disk-space-for-linux-from-windows-in-a-dual-bootable-machine)
[answers](https://askubuntu.com/questions/727112/give-more-hard-disk-space-to-ubuntu?rq=1)
addressing this matter.

These were helpful, but an error about `swapfile.sys` occurred when I tried Shrink Volume in Windows' Disk Management.
It turned out that `swapfile.sys` (and `pagefile.sys`) can be disabled and deleted, according to
[these](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-swapfile-sys-guide/)
[articles](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-pagefile-sys-guide/). Not using Windows very often nowadays, I am happy to remove them.

If I remembered correctly, I followed these steps to reassign some disk space from Windows to Ubuntu:

1. disable and delete `pagefile.sys` ([see steps here](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-pagefile-sys-guide/#:~:text=How%20to%20Delete%20Pagefile.sys));
2. now delete `swapfile.sys` ([refer to here](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-swapfile-sys-guide/#:~:text=How%20to%20Delete%20Swapfile.sys));
3. follow Option 2 in [this answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/871858/1410062);
4. mount the new partition on Ubuntu.
