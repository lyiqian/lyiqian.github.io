Bidly is a mobile app (only on Android for now) I built for contract bridge lovers.
By taking a photo of a complete bridge hand, it recognizes all 52 cards and
assigns them to four players based on card locations.
Then, the highest contract for each player is solved by a Double Dummy Solver.

The following screenshots should be self-explanatory.

### Limitations & Known Issues
For now, bidly has difficulties

- recognizing cards with non-standard symbols;
- recognizing cards when the lighting condition is not ideal;
- recognizing cards when they are too far away from the camera.
