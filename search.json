    "title": "Rule of 5-2-5",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I usually have somewhat high standards for myself (and sometimes also for people around me which does not usually result in a great ending). It does not make me happy to relax too much, as I felt I was wasting time and I could have achieved more. Being very productive, however, is only possible if the motivation-to-procrastination ratio is right. A balance needs to be reached. So I gradually figured out this Rule of 5-2-5, a combination of techniques working for my self-improvement.\nAbout priority, the first 5 of 5-2-5 stands for your 5 most important goals. These could be long-term or medium-term. To really know the five most important things to you, you need to know yourself first. What matters the most? Family/Friendship/Health/Spirit/Relaxation/Career/Wealth/…? This one is the toughest sub-rule of the three for me, as the goals (i.e. yourself) might change over time therefore require constant exploration.\nAbout productivity, the 2 means Top-2-do. Before bed, write down a mini to-do list with only two items. The next day, you will get these two items done. No excuse. This should help achieve your identified goals above. I found that a good to-do item is something taking half to two hours. For example, my Top-2-do for today was:\n\nMath (short for “read Math textbook”)\nblog (short for “write my next blog post”)\n\nAbout action, the last 5 tells me to just do it for 5 minutes. This one fixed my procrastination. Starting something is hard. Thinking about starting something before starting it is even harder. I understood. But it pays to just temporarily shift the attention away from those negative emotions, and make the reluctant me sit down. I promise myself I would do it for only 5 minutes. Sometimes I even start a timer to reassure myself it won’t take long. Then, pull one item from the Top-2-do list and work on it. What happens next is almost like a chain reaction.\nGive it a go! Just do it for 5 minutes, for each of the Top-2-do everyday, guided by your 5 most important goals. (Please be reminded of applying this to yourself, not people close to you.)"

    "title": "Camera Synchronization",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Master-slave camera synchronization (source)\n\n\nA binocular vision system has two eyes. In robotics domain, this means two cameras. An ideal binocular system should get visual input from both eyes at the same time, with 0 ms time difference. In other words, the triggers of the two cameras should be synchronized. 11 This is especially important when the scene being captured has dynamic or fast-moving objects.\nBefore talking about camera synchronization, we need to understand two ways of triggering a camera: software and hardware. The software trigger is straight-forward. Just as one could send an API command to adjust the exposure time, a trigger API will trigger a camera.\nThe hardware trigger is more advanced and not all cameras support it. A camera supporting hardware trigger has an additional interface than the typical USB socket. This interface (e.g. Figure 1) typically has multiple pins ready for input and/or output voltage signals. 2 One of the pins is responsible for trigger input. If you connect a wire to this pin and send in a voltage signal, it will trigger the camera. Another common pin is for flash output which can send out a voltage signal to an external flashlight.2 I believed hardware trigger was named due to these voltage signals since they are very low-level.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An interface for hardware trigger etc.\n\n\nCorresponding to software and hardware triggers, two types of synchronization exists. Again, software sync is simpler, which only requires calling trigger APIs as simultaneously as possible. As one can expect, software sync is not so precise (&gt;10ms).\nHardware sync takes advantage of hardware triggers. Traditional hardware sync needs an extra device sending voltage signals to cameras’ hardware trigger pins. If, like me, you did not have this device, you could still use a nice trick involving the flash output pin to achieve hardware sync, called master/slave sync in this case. Here are the steps for wiring etc:\n\nConnect both cameras to computer via USB and set their trigger modes to hardware;\nPrepare three wires and choose one camera as the master;\nConnect one wire to the master’s flash output pin;\nConnect one wire to each camera’s trigger input pin;\nConnect or solder the other ends of the three wires.\n\nAs some might have guessed, now when you send a flash API command to the master camera, both cameras will be hardware triggered. I would leave to the readers why and how this worked.\n\nUseful Documentations\nhttps://en.ids-imaging.com/techtipp-details/items/app-note-synchronizing-image-acquisition.html\nhttps://www.1stvision.com/cameras/IDS/IDS-manuals/uEye_Manual/hw_grundlagen_camerasync.html"

This caused various issues including occasional failure to recover from sleep.\nSurely, there were already some answers addressing this matter.\nThese were helpful, but an error about swapfile.sys occurred when I tried Shrink Volume in Windows’ Disk Management. It turned out that swapfile.sys (and pagefile.sys) can be disabled and deleted, according to these articles. Not using Windows very often nowadays, I am happy to remove them.\nIf I remembered correctly, I followed these steps to reassign some disk space from Windows to Ubuntu:\n\ndisable and delete pagefile.sys (see steps here);\nnow delete swapfile.sys (refer to here);\nfollow Option 2 in this answer;\nmount the new partition on Ubuntu."
